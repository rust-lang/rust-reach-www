        <h3>WebAssembly</h3>
        <p>WebAssembly("WASM") is a web standard that allows developers to run binary code in the browser.
        The Rust team is excited to make Rust a first class language for writing this type of code, and 
        has chosen WASM as one the four key domains in which we'd like to ship a first class developer
        experience this year.</p>
        <p>Michael was one of the original visionaries of the Rust/WASM pairing, writing about it in his <a href="https://mgattozzi.com/rust-wasm">blog in early December last year</a>. He's a member of the <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/come-join-the-rust-and-webassembly-working-group/6845">WASM working group</a> passionate about <a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi/status/974810805043679233">exploring possibilities via epic hacks</a> AND <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-wasm#rust-and-webassembly-book">beginner friendly documentation</a>.</p>

        <h3>rust-lang.org</h3>
        <p>rust-lang.org is the online home of the Rust Programming Lanuage and often the first impression new folks get of the project and community. We're planning on shipping a brand new design with lots of new content this year.</p>
        <p>Ashley is a member of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html#Core-team">Core Team</a>, lead of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-community/team">Community team</a>, and a member of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-wasm">WASM Working Group</a>. She is passionate about education and founded the <a href="https://www.nodetogether.org/">NodeTogether</a> program, and currently leads the <a href="https://rustbridge.github.io/">RustBridge</a> inclusive education initaive for Rust.</p>

        <h3>Embedded</h3>
        <p>Rust has the potential to make programming resource-constrained devices much more productiveâ€”and fun! We want embedded programming to reach first-class status this year.</p>

He is a member of the <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-embedded-devices-working-group/6839">Embedded Domain Working Group</a> and has taught many workshops on embedded programming and IoT, including one at <a href="http://zurich.rustfest.eu/sessions/workshop-embedded">RustFest 2017 in Zurich.</a></p>
